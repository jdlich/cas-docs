# Installation #

<p class="todo">TODO! Alas, this chapter is not yet written. You should help write it.</p>

_Intended scope of chapter: complete walk-through / documentation of installing CAS `war` as it ships in a CAS server distribution, *without* using Maven._

_The idea is to help a deployer to understand the moving pieces of the running system, to rapidly get to the CAS server rendering in a browser and reflecting changes directly applied to the software, and then circle back and discuss managing those changes and the build process for real._
